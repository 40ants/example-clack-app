    <p>This is the static part of the site.</p>
    <p>Whole content of the subdirectory are served as static.</p>
    <p>If directory does not have an index.html file, then automatic file index is generated. For example, try to open this link to see all images in the subdirectory <a href="/blog/images/">/blog/images/</a></p>

    <p>And of cause, you can referer these static files from the HTML:</p>
    <img src="/blog/images/made-with-lisp.svg" width="200"/>
